# complete ``.BO`` tapes return 94-95% of the window's weekdays (the missing
# 5-6% are exchange holidays); a truncated BSE tape returns a single latest bar
# whatever the window (0.1-0.4%); and a scrip asked for more years than it has
# been listed reaches 33-42% over five years and 59-70% over three. Nothing
# measured landed between 42% and 59%, so a cut inside that empty band
# misclassifies no observed case, and 50% keeps ~8 points of margin either side.

    The rule: count the weekdays (Mon-Fri) in ``[start_date, end_date]``

    a complete tape measures 94-95% rather than 100% — and call the history
    sparse when the frame holds fewer than half of them. Windows under 20
    weekdays are never judged: there is nothing meaningful for a 50% rule to
    measure in two weeks, and a holiday cluster can shorten a fortnight. A window
    that reaches back before the scrip listed is judged by the same rule, on
    purpose: a year of bars cannot answer a five-year question, and saying so
    beats analysing the year as if it were the window.

    Raises ``NoMarketDataError`` (detail carries both the bar count and the
    session count) so the router reports one honest "no usable prices" signal.
    It never substitutes the ``.NS`` series: a BSE quote is a different
    exchange's tape, so the hint names the NSE ticker and leaves the choice to
    the caller. Empty frames stay with ``raise_for_empty``, which can tell a
    delisting from an outage; this guard only judges frames that have rows.
